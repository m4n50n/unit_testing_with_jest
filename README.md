✏ *Using the [jest framework](https://jestjs.io/) to create the first code tests*.

## Instructions 📄

2. Download learnpack globally (if you don't have it already) using the following command in the terminal: `$ npm i learnpack -g`
3. Start the exercise: `$ learnpack start`

## What is this exercise about ❓

We are going to be using the Jest library to build a program capable of converting numeric values from one currency to another:

| Function name     | Description                                                           |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| fromDollarToYen   | Receives a dollar amount and returns equivalent amount in Japan Yen  |
| fromEuroToDollar  | Receives a Euro amount and returns equivalent amount in US Dollar     |
| fromYenToPound    | Reveives a Yen amount and equivalent amount in England Pound          |
